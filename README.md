## [Classic Snake Game](https://editor.p5js.org/ArturoGJ/present/OghNtDR5b) üêç
This project is a clone of the classic 'Snake' game made with P%JS and using Object oriented programming.  
I really like this project and you can actually play it. It keeps a count of your score and you can loose if you hit a wall or yourself.  
The biggest challenge for me while making this project was to figure out how the snake would actually grow.  
The only issue I see with this game is that the food can spawn in a place where your body is.
